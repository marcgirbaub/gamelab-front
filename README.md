# **Gamelab**

Gamelab is a mobile app that allows videogames developers to share the games they create. It is build using React Native, Typescrit, Jest and React Native Testing Library.

## **Features**

- Discover videogames
- Add and update your videogames
- Filter videogames by category
- Secure authentication using JWT tokens
- Cross-platform mobile app using React Native

## **Tech Stack**

- React Native: a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript
- TypeScript: a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type checking and other features to the language
- Redux Toolkit: a simplified and opinionated approach to using Redux that helps manage the app's global state
- Axios: a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
- JWT: a JSON-based open standard for creating access tokens that can be securely transmitted between parties.
- React Native Testing Library: a library that makes it easier to test React Native components
- Expo App: a client app that can be used to run and test your Expo app on a physical device without having to go through the process of setting up a development environment

## **Getting Started**

To get started using Gamelab, you'll need to have the following tools installed:

- Node.js
- npm

Once you have these tools installed, you can clone the Gamelab repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/isdi-coders-2023/Marc-Girbau-Final-Project-front-202301-bcn.git

cd Marc-Girbau-Final-Project-front-202301-bcn

npm install
```

The command **`npm start`** runs the app in the development mode. Download Expo Go app in your phone, scan the QR generated in the console and try it out.

## **Running tests**

Gamelab uses Jest and React Native Testing Library for unit and integration tests. To run the test suite, use the **`npm test`** command.
